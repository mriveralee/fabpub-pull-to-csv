-1,Personal Fabrication,"In this journal paper, we survey the related work in HCI and Computer Graphics over the last five years and
	provide a roadmap for future research. The question we try to answer is whether the technology will further
	progress towards consumers, which would allow the technology to scale from hundreds of thousands of users to
	hundreds of millions of users. Our analysis reveals that a transition to consumers first requires a hardware +
	software system that embodies the skills and expert knowledge that consumers lack [...]",Patrick Baudisch and Stefanie Mueller.,http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/HCI-055,dl/personal-fabrication.pdf,,,
2004,Making papercraft toys from meshes using strip-based approximate unfolding (ACM SIGGRAPH 2004),"We propose a new method for producing unfolded papercraft patterns of rounded toy animal figures from triangulated meshes by means of strip-based approximation. Although in principle a triangulated model can be unfolded simply by retaining as much as possible of its connectivity while checking for intersecting triangles in the unfolded plane, creating a pattern with tens of thousands of triangles is unrealistic. Our approach is to approximate the mesh model by a set of continuous triangle strips with no internal vertices. Initially, we subdivide our mesh into parts corresponding to the features of the model.

2013,Cost-effective printing of 3D objects with skin-frame structures (ACM SIGGRAPH Asia 2013),"3D printers have become popular in recent years and enable fabrication of custom objects for home users. However, the cost of the material used in printing remains high. In this paper, we present an automatic solution to design a skin-frame structure for the purpose of reducing the material cost in printing a given 3D object. The frame structure is designed by an optimization scheme which significantly reduces material volume and is guaranteed to be physically stable, geometrically approximate, and printable. Furthermore, the number of struts is minimized by solving an l0 sparsity optimization.  [...]","Weiming Wang, Tuanfeng Y.

Similarly if a slice is much larger than the one below it, it will droop unless supported. These areas are called overhangs [Evans 2012], and most 3D printing software provides automated generation of some kind of support structure. However, the support is waste, of both time and material, and this waste should be minimized.

Such holographic surfaces are usually manufactured with one dimensional diffraction gratings that are varying in periodicity and orientation over an entire sample in order to produce a wide range of diffraction effects such as gradients and kinematic (rotational) effects [...]","Antoine Toisoul, Daljit Singh Dhillon, Abhijeet Ghosh",https://doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275077,http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/rgi/wp-content/uploads/sites/74/2018/09/holographic_surfaces_paper_small.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq_XKGU0Dqg,http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/rgi/project/acquiring-spatially-varying-appearance-of-printed-holographic-surfaces/,SIGGRAPH ASIA 2018
2018,An Adaptive Parameterization for Efficient Material Acquisition and Rendering (SIGGRAPH ASIA 2018),"One of the key ingredients of any physically based rendering system is a detailed specification characterizing the interaction of light and matter of all materials present in a scene, typically via the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). Despite their utility, access to real-world BRDF datasets remains limited: this is because measurements involve scanning a four-dimensional domain at sufficient resolution, a tedious and often infeasibly time-consuming process. We propose a new parameterization that automatically adapts to the behavior of a material, warping the underlying 4D domain so that most of the volume maps to regions where the BRDF takes on non-negligible values, while irrelevant regions are strongly compressed.[...]","Jonathan Dupuy, Wenzel Jakob",https://doi.org/10.1145/3272127.3275059,http://rgl.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/media/papers/Dupuy2018Adaptive.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7xmodGYn34,http://rgl.epfl.ch/publications/Dupuy2018Adaptive,SIGGRAPH ASIA 2018

By mixing cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY) photochromic dyes into a single solution and leveraging the different absorption spectra of each dye, we can control each color channel in the solution separately. Our approach can transform single-material fabrication techniques, such as coating, into high-resolution multi-color processes. We discuss the material mixing procedure, modifications to the light source, and the algorithm to control each color channel.

Using KnitPick, we contribute a measured and photographed data set of 302 knitted textures. Based on findings from this data set, we contribute two algorithms for manipulating KnitGraphs. KnitCarving shapes a graph while respecting a texture, and KnitPatching combines graphs with disparate textures while maintaining a consistent shape. KnitPick is the first system to bridge the gap between hand- and machine-knitting when creating complex knitted textures.","Megan Hofmann, Lea Albaugh, Ticha Sethapakdi, Jessica Hodgins, Scott Hudson, James McCann, Jennifer Mankoff",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347886,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vpyS90D6VGzsC6IH0GrRNnpi7I9I6nXG/view,https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wF31lrQhh2yB4OCqboHFS39io4Z8XX9k/view,https://textiles-lab.github.io/publications/2019-knitpick/,ACM UIST 2019
2019,SensorSnaps: Integrating Wireless Sensor Nodes into Fabric Snap Fasteners for Textile Interfaces (ACM UIST 2019),"Adding electronics to textiles can be time-consuming and requires technical expertise. We introduce SensorSnaps, low-power wireless sensor nodes that seamlessly integrate into caps of fabric snap fasteners. SensorSnaps provide a new technique to quickly and intuitively augment any location on the clothing with sensing capabilities. SensorSnaps securely attach and detach from ubiquitous commercial snap fasteners. Using inertial measurement units, the SensorSnaps detect tap and rotation gestures, as well as track body motion. We optimized the power consumption for SensorSnaps to work continuously for 45 minutes and up to 4 hours in capacitive touch standby mode. We present applications in which the SensorSnaps are used as gestural interfaces for a music player controller, cursor control, and motion tracking suit. The user study showed that SensorSnap could be attached in around 71 seconds, similar to attaching off-the-shelf snaps, and participants found the gestures easy to learn and perform. SensorSnaps could allow anyone to effortlessly add sophisticated sensing capacities to ubiquitous snap fasteners.","Artem Dementyev, Tomás Vega Gálvez, Alex Olwal",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347913,http://www.artemdementyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SensorSnaps_UIST_2019.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjOOT8TG4HA,http://www.artemdementyev.com/portfolio/sensorsnaps/,ACM UIST 2019

By controlling the movement of the print header, the FDM alternately weaves the stringing fibers across a row of pillars. Owing to the structure of the fibers, which supports and strengthens the pillars from each side, a 3D printer can print a thin sheet of fabric in an upright position while the fibers are being woven. In addition, this technique enables users to employ materials with various colors and/or properties when designing a pattern, and to prototype an interactive object using a variety of off-the-shelf materials such as a conductive filament. We also describe a technique for weaving textiles and introduce a list of parameters that enable users to design their own textile variations.","Haruki Takahashi, Jeeeun Kim",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347896,http://www.jeeeunkim.com/papers/3dprintedfabric.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_KHSKNU4nI,https://haruki.xyz/printed_fabric.html,ACM UIST 2019

2019,Self-healing UI: Mechanically and Electrically Self-healing Materials for Sensing and Actuation Interfaces (ACM UIST 2019),"Living things in nature have long been utilizing the ability to ""heal"" their wounds on the soft bodies to survive in the outer environment. In order to impart this self-healing property to our daily life interface, we propose Self-healing UI, a soft-bodied interface that can intrinsically self-heal damages without external stimuli or glue. The key material to achieving Self-healing UI is MWCNTs-PBS, a composite material of a self-healing polymer polyborosiloxane (PBS) and a filler material multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), which retains mechanical and electrical self-healability. We developed a hybrid model that combines PBS, MWCNTs-PBS, and other common soft materials including fabric and silicone to build interface devices with self-healing, sensing, and actuation capability. These devices were implemented by layer-by-layer stacking fabrication without glue or any post-processing, by leveraging the materials' inherent self-healing property between two layers. We then demonstrated sensing primitives and interactive applications that extend the design space of shape-changing interfaces with their ability to transform, conform, reconfigure, heal, and fuse, which we believe can enrich the toolbox of human-computer interaction (HCI).","Koya Narumi, Fang Qin, Siyuan Liu, Huai-Yu Cheng, Jianzhe Gu, Yoshihiro Kawahara, Mohammad Islam, Lining Yao",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3347901,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1zfu5GYW8A,https://narumi.me/self-healing-ui,ACM UIST 2019

A swarm of self-transformable robots can both individually and collectively change their configuration to display information, actuate objects, act as tangible controllers, visualize data, and provide physical affordances. ShapeBots is a concept prototype of shape-changing swarm robots. Each robot can change its shape by leveraging small linear actuators that are thin (2.5 cm) and highly extendable (up to 20cm) in both horizontal and vertical directions. The modular design of each actuator enables various shapes and geometries of self-transformation. We illustrate potential application scenarios and discuss how this type of interface opens up possibilities for the future of ubiquitous and distributed shape-changing interfaces.","Ryo Suzuki, Clement Zheng, Yasuaki Kakehi, Tom Yeh, Ellen Yi-Luen Do, Mark D.

To achieve these manipulations, we customize a low-cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer that can attach/detach printed end-effectors which change the function of the 3D printer head (e.g. grab, break, and rotate printed objects). These techniques afford the 3D printer to fabricate and assemble complete kinetic objects such as automatons without manual processing (i.e. removing support materials and assembling objects).

Automating these simple physical tasks has the potential to improve people's quality of life, which is particularly important for people with a disability or in situational impairment. We present Robiot -- a design tool for generating mechanisms that can be attached to, motorized, and actuating legacy static objects to perform simple physical tasks. Users only need to take a short video manipulating an object to demonstrate an intended physical behavior. Robiot then extracts requisite parameters and automatically generates 3D models of the enabling actuation mechanisms by performing a scene and motion analysis of the 2D video in alignment with the object's 3D model.

Unfortunately, mounts and joints tend to fail when trying to fabricate a model on a different laser cutter or from a different material. The reason for this lies in the way mounts and joints hold objects in place, which is by forc-ing them into slightly smaller openings. Such ""press fit"" mechanisms unfortunately are susceptible to the small changes in diameter that occur when switching to a ma-chine that removes more or less material (""kerf""), as well as to changes in stiffness, as they occur when switching to a different material.

The process is implemented as follows. Taking a set of branches and a user-defined parametric target surface, the system makes a reciprocal pattern of curves that lie on the surface. Then, it automatically matches the shapes of the scanned branches with these curves. There was a similar attempt to build a large beam structure from tree trunks using industrial equipment such as cranes and robot arms.

However, existing construction materials can not be used for 3D printing as they are, and the exploration for new materials is the key to the realization of this concept. Formability and fluidity are the key factors in evaluating whether or not materials are suitable for 3D printing, including use within the field of architecture. A standardized quantitative method to evaluate construction materials is required for the comparison between materials for various projects. For example, the concrete slump test is one of the universal standards that is used to evaluate the quality and suitability for a specific construction method. In the emerging field of construction with 3D printing, however, a standardized method is yet to be established. This paper proposes an efficient method to evaluate the formability and fluidity of concrete-based materials, while only using simple instruments.

A 3D surface is called convex if the entire surface lies on the boundary of its convex hull.",Yue Hao and Jyh-Ming Lien,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3329006,http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/uploads/LaserOrigami/scf-19.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_LxcsXZRQc,http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/LaserOrigami,ACM SCF 2019
2019,Weaving Geodesic Foliations (ACM SIGGRAPH 2019),"We study discrete geodesic foliations of surfaces---foliations whose leaves are all approximately geodesic curves---and develop several new variational algorithms for computing such foliations. Our key insight is a relaxation of vector field integrability in the discrete setting, which allows us to optimize for curl-free unit vector fields that remain well-defined near singularities and robustly recover a scalar function whose gradient is well aligned to these fields. We then connect the physics governing surfaces woven out of thin ribbons to the geometry of geodesic foliations, and present a design and fabrication pipeline for approximating surfaces of arbitrary geometry and topology by triaxially-woven structures, where the ribbon layout is determined by a geodesic foliation on a sixfold branched cover of the input surface. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on a variety of simulated and fabricated woven designs, including an example for readers to try at home.","Josh Vekhter,

2019,Interactive Hand Pose Estimation Using A Stretch-Sensing Soft Glove (ACM SIGGRAPH 2019),"We propose a stretch-sensing soft glove to interactively capture hand poses with high accuracy and without requiring an external optical setup. We demonstrate how our device can be fabricated and calibrated at low cost, using simple tools available in most fabrication labs. To reconstruct the pose from the capacitive sensors embedded in the glove, we propose a deep network architecture that exploits the spatial layout of the sensor itself. The network is trained only once, using an inexpensive off-the-shelf hand pose reconstruction system to gather the training data. The per-user calibration is then performed on-the-fly using only the glove. The glove's capabilities are demonstrated in a series of ablative experiments, exploring different models and calibration methods. Comparing against commercial data gloves, we achieve a 35% improvement in reconstruction accuracy.","Oliver Glauser,

2019,Learning To Fly: Computational Controller Design For Hybrid UAVs With Reinforcement Learning (ACM SIGGRAPH 2019),"Hybrid unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) combine advantages of multicopters and fixed-wing planes: vertical take-off, landing, and low energy use. However, hybrid UAVs are rarely used because controller design is challenging due to its complex, mixed dynamics. In this paper, we propose a method to automate this design process by training a mode-free, model-agnostic neural network controller for hybrid UAVs. We present a neural network controller design with a novel error convolution input trained by reinforcement learning. Our controller exhibits two key features: First, it does not distinguish among flying modes, and the same controller structure can be used for copters with various dynamics. Second, our controller works for real models without any additional parameter tuning process, closing the gap between virtual simulation and real fabrication. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller both in simulation and in our custom-built hybrid UAVs. The experiments show that the controller is robust to exploit the complex dynamics when both rotors and wings are active in flight tests.","Jie Xu, Tao Du, Michael Foshey, Beichen Li, Bo Zhu, Adriana Schulz, Wojciech Matusik",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3290605.3300858,http://cfg.mit.edu/sites/cfg.mit.edu/files/learning_to_fly.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOuOxgJzsgI,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3322940,ACM SIGGRAPH 2019

We present the first general visual programming interface for creating 3D objects with complex surface finishes on industrial knitting machines. At the core of our interface is a new, augmented, version of the stitch mesh data structure. The augmented stitch mesh stores low-level knitting operations per-face and encodes the dependencies between faces using directed edge labels. Our system can generate knittable augmented stitch meshes from 3D models, allows users to edit these meshes in a way that preserves their knittability, and can schedule the execution order and location of each face for production on a knitting machine. Our system is general, in that its knittability-preserving editing operations are sufficient to transform between any two machine-knittable stitch patterns with the same orientation on the same surface. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our pipeline by using it to create and knit objects featuring a wide range of patterns and textures, including intarsia and Fair Isle colorwork; knit and purl textures; cable patterns; and laces.","Vidya Narayanan,

Manufacturing such objects in a single piece is often challenging or even impossible. The alternative is to partition them into single-attribute volumetric parts that can be fabricated separately and then assembled to form the target object. Facilitating this approach requires partitioning the input model into parts that conform to the surface segmentation and that can be moved apart with no collisions. We propose Surface2Volume, a partition algorithm capable of producing such assemblable parts, each of which is affiliated with a single attribute, the outer surface of whose assembly conforms to the input surface geometry and segmentation. In computing the partition we strictly enforce conformity with surface segmentation and assemblability, and optimize for ease of fabrication by minimizing part count, promoting part simplicity, and simplifying assembly sequencing.","Chrystiano Araújo, Daniela Cabiddu, Marco Attene, Marco Livesu, Nicholas Vining, Alla Sheffer",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3323004,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.10213,,http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2019/Surface2Volume/,ACM SIGGRAPH 2019

Using thinner slices reduces this effect, but it always remains visible where layers almost align with the input surfaces.
In this research we exploit the ability of some additive manufacturing processes to deposit material slightly out of plane to dramatically reduce these artifacts. We focus in particular on the widespread Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology, since most printers in this category can deposit along slightly curved paths, under deposition slope and thickness constraints.","Jimmy Etienne, Nicolas Ray, Daniele Panozzo, Samuel Hornus, Charlie Wang, Jonàs Martínez, Sara Mcmains, Marc Alexa, Brian Wyvill, Sylvain Lefebvre",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3323022,https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/papers/2019-CurviSlicer.pdf,,https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02120033,ACM SIGGRAPH 2019

In particular, the combination of fast motions and unavoidable structural deformations leads to mechanical oscillations that negatively affect their performances. Our goal is to automatically transfer motions created using traditional animation software to robotic characters while avoiding such artifacts. To this end, we develop an optimization-based, dynamics-aware motion retargeting system that adjusts an input motion such that visually salient low-frequency, large amplitude vibrations are suppressed. The technical core of our animation system consists of a differentiable dynamics simulator that provides constraint-based two-way coupling between rigid and flexible components.

We propose SurfaceBrush, a surfacing method that converts such VR drawings into user-intended manifold free-form 3D surfaces, providing a novel approach for modeling 3D shapes. The inputs to our method consist of dense collections of artist-drawn stroke ribbons described by the positions and normals of their central polylines, and ribbon widths. These inputs are highly distinct from those handled by existing surfacing frameworks and exhibit different sparsity and error patterns, necessitating a novel surfacing approach. We surface the input stroke drawings by identifying and leveraging local coherence between nearby artist strokes. In particular, we observe that strokes intended to be adjacent on the artist imagined surface often have similar tangent directions along their respective polylines. We leverage this local stroke direction consistency by casting the computation of the user-intended manifold surface as a constrained matching problem on stroke polyline vertices and edges.","Enrique Rosales, Jafet Rodriguez, Alla Sheffer",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3322970,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.12297.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGZYCZLp_rk,https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12297,ACM SIGGRAPH 2019

The fabrication process only takes a few minutes allowing to rapidly prototype functional interactive devices. The resulting objects are lightweight and rigid, thus allowing for weight-sensitive and force-sensitive applications. Finally, due to the nature of the honeycomb structure, the objects can be folded flat along one axis and thus can be efficiently transported in this compact form factor.

However, at present ability to manufacture functional objects is limited by available materials (e.g., various polymers) and their process properties. For instance, many functional objects need stronger materials which may be satisfied with metal printers. However, to create wholly interactive devices, we need both conductors and insulators to create wiring, and electronic components to complete circuits. Unfortunately, the single material nature of metal printing, and its inherent high temperatures, preclude this. Thus, in 3D printed devices, we have had a choice of strong materials, or embedded interactivity, but not both. In this paper, we introduce a set of techniques we call FiberWire, which leverages a new commercially available capability to 3D print carbon fiber composite objects.

Users then extend their model by attaching additional boxels. Boxels merge automatically, resulting in larger, yet equally strong structures.

These patterns enable the designer to customize the desired stretchability of the circuit, to combine stretchable with non-stretchable areas, or to integrate areas of different stretchability. For adding circuits on such stretchable cut patterns, we contribute routing strategies and a real-time routing algorithm. An interactive design tool assists designers by automatically generating patterns and circuits from a high-level specification of the desired interface. The approach is compatible with off-the-shelf materials and can realize transparent interfaces. Several application examples demonstrate the versatility of the novel technique for applications in wearable computing, interactive textiles, and stretchable input devices.","Daniel Groeger,

2019,"ElectroDermis: Fully Untethered, Stretchable, and Highly-Customizable Electronic Bandages (ACM CHI 2019)","Wearables have emerged as an increasingly promising interactive platform, imbuing the human body with always-available computational capabilities. This unlocks a wide range of applications, including discreet information access, health monitoring, fitness, and fashion. However, unlike previous platforms, wearable Electronics require structural conformity, must be comfortable for the wearer, and should be soft, elastic, and aesthetically appealing. We envision a future where Electronics can be temporarily attached to the body (like bandages or party masks), but in functional and aesthetically pleasing ways. Towards this vision, we introduce ElectroDermis, a fabrication approach that simplifies the creation of highly-functional and stretchable wearable Electronics that are conformal and fully untethered by discretizing rigid circuit boards into individual components.","Eric Markvicka,

2019,VirtualComponent: A Mixed-Reality Tool for Designing and Tuning Breadboarded Circuits (ACM CHI 2019),"Prototyping electronic circuits is an increasingly popular activity, supported by researchers, who develop toolkits to improve the design, debugging, and fabrication of Electronics. Although past work mainly dealt with circuit topology, in this paper we propose a system for determining or tuning the values of the circuit components. Based on the results of a formative study with seventeen makers, we designed VirtualComponent, a mixed-reality tool that allows users to digitally place electronic components on a real breadboard, tune their values in software, and see these changes applied to the physical circuit in real-time.","Yoonji Kim,

2019,AutoFritz: Autocomplete for Prototyping Virtual Breadboard Circuits (ACM CHI 2019),"We propose autocomplete for the design and development of virtual breadboard circuits using software prototyping tools. With our system, a user inserts a component into the virtual breadboard, and it automatically provides a user with a list of suggested components. These suggestions complete or extend the electronic functionality of the inserted component to save the user's time and reduce circuit error. To demonstrate the effectiveness of autocomplete, we implemented our system on Fritzing, a popular open source breadboard circuit prototyping software, used by novice makers. Our autocomplete suggestions were implemented based upon schematics from datasheets for standard components, as well as how components are used together from over 4000 circuit projects from the Fritzing community.","Jo-Yu Lo,

Manual probing methods are slow and error prone, and even dedicated PCB testing equipment remains limited by its inability to modify the circuit during testing. We present Pinpoint, a tool that facilitates in-circuit PCB debugging through techniques such as programmatically probing signals, dynamically disconnecting components and subcircuits to test in isolation, and splicing in new elements to explore potential modifications. Pinpoint automatically instruments a PCB design and generates designs for a physical jig board that interfaces the user's PCB to our custom testing hardware and to software tools.","Evan Strasnick,

A-line integrates a method of bending angle control in up to eight directions for one printed line segment, using a single type of thermoplastic material.","Guanyun Wang,

However, the uptake of EAP prototyping in design, art and architecture has been slow due to limited commercial availability, challenging high voltage electronics and lack of simple fabrication techniques. This paper introduces DIY tools for building and activating EAP prototypes, together with design methods for making novel Shape-changing surfaces and structures, outside of material science labs.

However, to our knowledge, all the known examples are either origami-based models with obvious folding hinges, or beam-based models with holes on the morphing surfaces. Morphing continuous double-curvature surfaces remains a challenge, both in terms of a tailored toolpath-planning strategy and a computational model that simulates it. Additionally, neither approach takes surface texture as a design parameter in its computational pipeline. To extend the design space of FDM-based 4D printing, in Geodesy, we focus on the morphing of continuous double-curvature surfaces or surface textures.","Jianzhe Gu,

2019,Strong 3D Printing by TPMS Injection (IEEE TVCG 2019),"3D printed objects are rapidly becoming prevalent in science, technology and daily life. An important question is how to obtain strong and durable 3D models using standard printing techniques. This question is often translated to computing smartly designed interior structures that provide strong support and yield resistant 3D models. In this paper we suggest a combination between 3D printing and material injection to achieve strong 3D printed objects. We utilize triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) to define novel interior support structures.","Xin Yan, Cong Rao, Lin Lu, Andrei Sharf, Haisen Zhao, and Baoquan Chen",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8703138,https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~haisen/paper/injection.pdf,,,IEEE TVCG 2019

fabrication, i.e. rather than working through a digital editor,
users make edits directly on the physical workpiece. However, so far the interaction has been limited to turn-taking,
i.e., users first perform a command and then the system
responds with physical feedback. In this paper, we present
a first step towards interactive fabrication that changes the
workpiece continuously while the user is manipulating it.","Stefanie Mueller, Anna Seufert, Huaishu Peng, Robert Kovacs, Kevin Reuss,

that can be programmed to actuate by a range of external and
internal stimuli. However, there exists a dichotomy between
the physicality of the actuators and the intangible computational signal that is used to program them. For material practitioners, this lack of physical cues limits their ability to engage
in a ""conversation with materials"" (CwM). This paper presents
a creative workstation for supporting this epistemological style
by bringing a stronger physicality to the computational signal
and balance the conversation between physical and digital actors.","Cesar Torres, Molly Jane Nicholas, Sangyeon Lee, Eric Paulos",https://doi.org/10.1145/3294109.3295643,http://www.hybrid-ecologies.org/uploads/project/paper/32/teifp1109-torresA.pdf,,http://www.hybrid-ecologies.org/projects/32,ACM TEI 2019
2019,Sequential Support: 3D Printing Dissolvable Support Material for Time-Dependent Mechanisms (ACM TEI 2019),"In this paper, we propose a different perspective on the use of support material: rather than printing support structures for overhangs, our idea is to make use of its transient nature, i.e. the fact that it can be dissolved when placed in a solvent, such as water. This enables a range of new use cases, such as quickly dissolving and replacing parts of a prototype during design iteration, printing temporary assembly labels directly on the ob-ject that leave no marks when dissolved, and creating time-dependent mechanisms, such as fading in parts of an image in a shadow art piece or releasing relaxing scents from a 3D printed structure sequentially over-night. Since we use regular support material (PVA), our approach works on consumer 3D printers without any modifications.","Martin Nisser, Junyi Zhu, Tianye Chen, Katarina Bulovic, Parinya Punpongsanon, Stefanie Mueller",https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3295630,http://groups.csail.mit.edu/hcie/files/research-projects/sequential-support/2019-TEI-SequentialSupport-paper.pdf,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-22KOGFLoQ&t=0s,https://hcie.csail.mit.edu/research/sequential-support/sequential-support.html,ACM TEI 2019

The method starts by analyzing the input CAD model and generates a set of carving instructions. Then using a projector, we project the instructions sequentially one at a time to a block of material to guide the user in performing each of them. After each cutting step, we use the projector-camera setup to 3D scan the object after cutting. And automatically align the scanned point cloud to the CAD model, to prepare the position for the next instruction. We demonstrate a complete system to support this operation and show several examples manually carved while using the system.","Ammar Hattab, Gabriel Taubin",https://doi.org/10.1145/3294109.3295644,https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=3295644&ftid=2044691&dwn=1&CFID=34689519&CFTOKEN=265ecfc8df8480de-B6AD83BC-D45F-D3DF-A33AF8BC59FDADCA,,,ACM TEI 2019
